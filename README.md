# Crop-Disease-Detection
Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning — Upload a leaf image to predict the crop disease and get fertilizer suggestions. Built with TensorFlow, achieving high accuracy on real-world agricultural data.
🌾 Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning
This project aims to help farmers and agricultural experts quickly detect crop diseases from leaf images using a deep learning model. Once a disease is identified, the system also suggests appropriate fertilizers or treatment methods.

🚀 Features
Upload an image of a crop leaf.

Automatically predict the disease affecting the crop.

Get fertilizer recommendations based on the diagnosis.

Built with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.

High accuracy achieved on real-world agricultural datasets.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Streamlit (for web app deployment)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

📊 Dataset
Images of healthy and diseased crop leaves.

Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
